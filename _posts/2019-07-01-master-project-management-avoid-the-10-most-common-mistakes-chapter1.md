# CHAPTER 1: Introduction

What topic we going to cover

- Introduction
- Briefly touch about project management
- And type of project management methodology

# What is project

Is a project when met any of this criteria 

- Take more then 2 weeks
- More than 10 tasks
- More than 1 person

# Project management methodology

## Prince 2

- A high level framework. To ensure we have a plan before we start a project
- Only tell you "what you need to have" but not specifically "how you going to do it"
- Because of that, you can use APM inside Prince2

## Agile

- Good if requirement not confirmed
- Flexible. Can change along the development
- But no actual planning

## APM (associate in project management)

- Known as standard waterfall / gantt chart
- Also known as PMI (project management institute)

# CHAPTER 2: 12 step process

We going to focus on APO

# What is this about

- Focus on APM
- Key parts of APM process
- Focus on small project
- Step 1: Start
- Step 2 - 8: Planning
- Step 9 - 11: Monitoring
- Step 12: Review

## Step 1: Define the project

- Write down what are we going to do
- Also good to write down what we not going to do
- Make sure the writing get approval from stakeholders
- Done during kick-off meeting

## Kick-off meeting

- Have a "kickoff" meeting. To get every stakeholder agree about what we going to deliver
- Be "assertive" during kickoff meeting. Looks confident but dont promise things that is impossible

## Step 2: List all the task

- TODO: But how detail? Refer Lecture no.8

## Step 3: Estimate the time and cost for each task

- Time can be 2. Actual working and Elapses time (eg: waiting raw material to arrive)
- Actual working in hours. Elapses is weeks
- TODO: What is Elapses time?

## Step 4: Put task in a running order

- The output should be: Project network diagram
- Picture of network diagram: https://inlooxcdn.azureedge.net/var/corporate_site/storage/images/media/images/blog/netzplan/back-to-basics-10-netzplan-schritt-6-2-freier-puffer/1297512-2-eng-GB/back-to-basics-10-netzplan-schritt-6-2-freier-puffer.png

## Step 5: Speed up network diagram

## Step 6: Do Gantt chart

## Step 7: Resources allocation

## Step 8: Risk

- Measure likelihood & seriousness
- Example: Rain is very likely but not serious. Earthquake is very serious but not very likely
- Risk & mitigation of risk

## Step 9: Monitor timeline

## Step 10: Monitor spending

## Step 11: Adjust planning

## Step 12: Rigid the plan

- Handling requirement change

## Step 13: Review everything

- Write everything you learn

# CHAPTER 3: Top 10 mistakes

## Mistake 1: Having the plan in your head

- Might get too complicated
- To present to others, your superior and subordinate

### Mistake 1 solution: Draw "Network diagram"

- TODO: Still WIP
- List all task. 
- Self add: To list all task, start from result and backtrack to the beginning
- Estimate time per task
- Put all task into post-it-notes
- Link all path for each notes
- Get the longest path known as Critical path
- TODO: Find network diagram tutorial, example but not nice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bobDz_Bh3tI

### Mistake 1 solution: Draw "Gantt Chart"

- From the network diagram. Draw the Critical path
- After that draw floating task
- TODO: Watch BONUS section to check how to do detail Gantt Chart

## Mistake 2: Saying "Maybe" or "I will try"

- It means saying "YES"
- You will suffer at the end

### Mistake 2 solution: Draw "Network diagram before answer"

- Do network diagram and only can say "YES"
- Then you can also say "NO" or "YES" if we skip this task

## Mistake 3: Answering killer question

- If asked "How fast it can finish" NEVER answer the best scenario

## Mistake 3 solution: Avoid answering the question directly

- Avoid answer the question directly
- Give more realistic answer like with buffer

## Mistake 4: Not involving with teams

- When do task, only do by your self. You should involve the team together in every aspect
- This is important to digest, re-watch this tutorial!! <-- TODO

## Mistake 4 solution: Let team involve

Example

- List all the task & Put task in a running order = Do brainstorm
- Estimate = Ask each team to do estimation
- TODO: List all the task and suggest how to involve team

## Mistake 5: Listing only the task

- Means no Gantt chart
- Means not proper plan and risky

## Mistake 5 solution: Do a Gantt chart

- Do a Gantt chart. Here few example of TODO TODO
- 20% No plan at all
- 25% Plan in one person head
- 25% Plan is in the list, not Gantt chart
- 20% Have Gantt chart but no Critical path or not proper
- 10% properly done!
