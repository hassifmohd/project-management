# CHAPTER 1: Introduction

What topic we are going to cover

- Introduction
- Briefly touch about project management
- Also, the type of project management methodology

# What is a project

Is a project when met any of these criteria 

- Take more than two weeks
- More than ten tasks
- More than one person

# Project management methodology

## Prince 2

- A high-level framework. To ensure we have a plan before we start a project
- Only tell you "what you need to have" but not specifically "how you going to do it."
- Because of that, you can use APM inside Prince2

## Agile

- Good if requirement not confirmed
- Flexible. Can change along with the development
- However, no actual planning

## APM (associate in project management)

- Known as the standard waterfall / Gantt chart
- Also known as PMI (project management institute)

# CHAPTER 2: 12 step process

We are going to focus on APO.

# What is this about

- Focus on APM
- Critical parts of the APM process
- Focus on a small project
- Step 1: Start
- Step 2 - 8: Planning
- Step 9 - 11: Monitoring
- Step 12: Review

## Step 1: Define the project

- Write down what are we going to do
- Also good to write down what we are not going to do
- Make sure the writing get approval from stakeholders
- Done during a kick-off meeting

## Kick-off meeting

- Have a "kickoff" meeting. To get every stakeholder to agree about what we are going to deliver
- Be "assertive" during the kickoff meeting. Looks confident but don't promise impossible things

## Step 2: List all the task

- TODO: But how detail? Refer Lecture no.8

## Step 3: Estimate the time and cost for each task

- Time can be 2. Actual working and Elapses time (example waiting for raw material to arrive)
- Actual working in hours. Elapses is weeks
- TODO: What is Elapses time?

## Step 4: Put the task in a running order

- The output should be: Project network diagram
- Picture of network diagram: https://inlooxcdn.azureedge.net/var/corporate_site/storage/images/media/images/blog/netzplan/back-to-basics-10-netzplan-schritt-6-2-freier-puffer/1297512-2-eng-GB/back-to-basics-10-netzplan-schritt-6-2-freier-puffer.png
- https://www.inloox.com/company/blog/articles/back-to-basics-part-10-how-to-create-a-project-network-diagram/

## Step 5: Speed up a network diagram

## Step 6: Do Gantt chart

## Step 7: Resources allocation

## Step 8: Risk

- Measure likelihood & seriousness
- Example: Rain is very likely but not critical. Earthquake is critical but not very likely
- Risk & mitigation of risk

## Step 9: Monitor timeline

## Step 10: Monitor spending

## Step 11: Adjust planning

## Step 12: Rigid the plan

- Handling requirement change

## Step 13: Review everything

- Write everything you learn

# CHAPTER 3: Top 10 mistakes

## Mistake 1: Having the plan in your head

- Might get too complicated
- To present to others, your superior and subordinate

### Mistake 1 solution: Draw  a Network diagram

- TODO: Still WIP
- List all task. 
- TODO: Self adds: To list all task, start from result and backtrack to the beginning
- Estimate time per task
- Put all task into post-it-notes
- Link all path for each note
- Get the longest path known as Critical path
- TODO: Find network diagram tutorial, example but not nice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bobDz_Bh3tI

### Mistake 1 solution: Draw Gantt Chart

- From the network diagram. Draw the Critical path
- After that draw floating task
- TODO: Watch BONUS section to check how to do detail Gantt Chart

## Mistake 2: Saying "Maybe" or "I will try."

- It means saying, "YES."
- You will suffer at the end

### Mistake 2 solution: Draw "Network diagram before answer."

- Do network diagram and only can say "YES."
- Then you can also say "NO" or "YES" if we skip this task

## Mistake 3: Answering killer question

- If you asked "How fast it can finish" NEVER answer the best scenario

## Mistake 3 solution: Avoid answering the question directly

- Avoid answer the question directly
- Give a more realistic answer like with buffer

## Mistake 4: Not involving with teams

- When you do a task, only do by your self. It would be best if you involved the team together in every aspect
- TODO: important to digest, re-watch this tutorial

## Mistake 4 solution: Let the team involve

Example

- List all the task & Put the task in a running order = Do brainstorm
- Estimate = Ask each team to do estimation
- TODO: List all the task and suggest how to involve team

## Mistake 5: Listing only the task

- Means no Gantt chart
- Means not properly plan and risky

## Mistake 5 solution: Do a Gantt chart

- Do a Gantt chart. Here few examples of TODO TODO
- 20% No plan at all
- 25% Plan in one person head
- 25% Plan is in the list, no Gantt chart
- 20% Have Gantt chart but no Critical path or not proper
- 10% properly done!

## Mistake 6: Not planning across project

- Not keep track or manage multiple projects

## Mistake 6: Do Gantt chart combination

- If you have multiple projects, then you need to combine all Cantt chart
- TODO: put the picture as an example
- Can see how many projects running at the same time
- Can quickly get an update for each project's status
- Can see future project bottleneck
- Gantt chart combination is usable for Boss, PM, and Team

## Mistake 7: Stories VS Gantt chart

- Telling project progress using stories instead of colored in Gantt chart
- Because we say "we were making much progress," but we did not explain what the progress should be
- If people tell stories can be dangerous because they could be hiding something

## Mistake 7 solution: Do a colored in Gantt chart

- Tell current progress VS what progress should be. To see the project is keeping up

## Mistake 8: Thinking underspend is ok

- Underspend is a sign that the project is behind schedule

## Mistake 8 solution: Check the colored Gantt chart

- Check do underspend VS progress is matching

## Mistake 9: Rescheduling too late

- Meaning, approaching the delivery date and the customer gets a bad new which is the project delay
- Project manager reschedule late because they hope for a miracle

## Mistake 9 solution: Confess early & take action

- The significant point is "no surprises."
- Update customer and upper management early
- Take action, example: extend the due date, increase manpower or reduce the requirement
- If the first half of the project has problems. The second half will too. Identify the problem and take action to prevent it happen again. It can be your plan or your team

## Mistake 10: Not do project review

Can be many reasons

| Reasons | Counter |
|---|---|
| Busy, no time and take cost | Part of project management |
| Don't want to reveal our mistake | Make it anonymous |
| Assume project is unique, no need review | Can happen in future |
| Think not benefiting you | It benefits the company |
| Nobody going to read | Share it with people |

## Mistake 10 solution: Do project review

Do project review. One of the tricks is to make a sociable occasion like a meetup with lunch.

- Do review within two weeks
- What is good
- What is bad
- How to make the project better
- Use the opportunity to thank people
- Summarize in one page
