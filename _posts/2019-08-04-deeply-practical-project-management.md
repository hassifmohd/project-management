# What is project?

- A project is a temporary and unique journey to create a new web application
- Unique means you don't know anything about it and did not happen ragularly
- If a project is not unique and happen regularly, then this is not a project, this should be called a *process* instead

# What is program manager?

Note: I skip this, detail please refer [here](https://www.udemy.com/deeply-practical-project-management/learn/lecture/7377646#overview)

Project manager VS program manager

- A person who manage multiple "project managers" is called "program manager"
- As a Project manager, you need to report to program manager monthly or weekly (it depends)

Role example of a program manager

- Company ABC have multiple projects but using same developers. Each projects manage by different project manager
- Therefore, program manager need to allocate developers accordingly (coordinate organization resources)
- Then take update from each project managers, see their Gantt chart VS current progress
